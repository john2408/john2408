# Hi there, I'm John Torres! 👋  

🚀 **Passionate Data Enthusiast | ML Practitioner | Automation Advocate**  

I thrive on solving complex problems through innovative machine learning solutions and automation. With a keen interest in AI, time series forecasting, and algorithmic trading, I enjoy building tools that make data-driven decision-making seamless and scalable.

## 🔍 **What I’m Working On**  

- **RAG and AI Agents**: Building RAG system with OpenAI and Ollama. As well as leveraging the use of AI Agents to create a small stock forecast Agent ([Stock-Forecast-AI-Agent])(https://github.com/john2408/stock_forecast_ai_agent))
- **Machine Learning Development**: Dockerized Jupyter-based environments for reproducible ML workflows ([ML_dev_container](https://github.com/john2408/ML_dev_container)).  
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Leveraging advanced algorithms and wavelet transformations ([Timeseries_Wavelet](https://github.com/john2408/Timeseries_Wavelet)).  
- **AI for Automated Trading**: Tensor-driven cryptocurrency trading strategies ([TensorTrader-System](https://github.com/john2408/tensortrader-system)).  
- **Azure ML Integration**: Custom Docker images for scalable machine learning ([Azure_ML_Training_Job](https://github.com/john2408/Azure_ML_Training_Job)).
